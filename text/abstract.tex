Confidential data  - data that cannot be publicly distributed in the form that the original author used it - is often the topic of criticism when used in economic research, as it is perceived to not lend itself to reproducible research. In this session, we outline why that need not be the case, and why, in fact, restricted-access environments can in fact be at the vanguard of reproducible research.
