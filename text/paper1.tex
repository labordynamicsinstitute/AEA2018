\paragraph{One sentence description} Success and failure of reproducibility in a journal
\paragraph{Abstract} We describe effective reproducibility - the ability to actually download and re-execute the archives as provided by the authors - for a single journal with a replication policy, and analyze the causes for non-reproducibility. Reproducibility fails primarily when data are not accessible, but also fails because authors are not able to convey what protocols are available to reproduce their work. Furthermore, in all cases, authors failed to provide programs that link back to the original data.
